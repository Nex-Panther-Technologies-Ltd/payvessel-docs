PayVessel's REST API provides programmatic access to accept payments, send money, verify identities, manage wallets, and more. Our API is organized around REST principles with predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes and authentication.

## Authentication

All API requests must be authenticated with your **secret API key** using Bearer token authentication. Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl https://api.payvessel.com/transaction/initialize \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```javascript Node.js
const payvessel = require('payvessel')(YOUR_SECRET_KEY);
```

```php PHP
<?php
$payvessel = new \Payvessel\Payvessel(YOUR_SECRET_KEY);
?>
```

```python Python
import payvessel
payvessel.api_key = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
**Keep your API keys secure!** Your secret API key can perform any API request to PayVessel without restriction. Store your secret key securely and never expose it in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Request & Response Format

### Request Headers
All requests should include these headers:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Response Structure
All API responses follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "status": "success|error",
  "message": "Descriptive message",
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  },
  "meta": {
    "total": 100,
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 20
  }
}
```

### HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `200` | **OK** - The request was successful |
| `201` | **Created** - The resource was successfully created |
| `400` | **Bad Request** - The request was invalid or malformed |
| `401` | **Unauthorized** - Authentication credentials were missing or invalid |
| `403` | **Forbidden** - The request is understood, but not authorized |
| `404` | **Not Found** - The requested resource could not be found |
| `429` | **Too Many Requests** - Rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | **Internal Server Error** - An error occurred on PayVessel's servers |

## Idempotency

The PayVessel API supports [idempotency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. When creating or modifying objects, provide an additional `Idempotency-Key: <key>` header to the request.

<Note>
**Best Practice**: Use a UUID or other random string as your idempotency key. PayVessel will return the same response for repeated requests with the same key for 24 hours.
</Note>

## Webhooks

PayVessel uses webhooks to notify your application when events occur in your account. Learn more about webhook integration in our [webhook documentation](/api-basics/webhooks).

Common webhook events:
- `transaction.success` - Payment completed successfully
- `transaction.failed` - Payment failed or was declined
- `transfer.success` - Transfer completed successfully
- `verification.completed` - Identity verification completed

## Testing

Use our sandbox environment to test your integration without real money. The sandbox mirrors the production API but with test data.
