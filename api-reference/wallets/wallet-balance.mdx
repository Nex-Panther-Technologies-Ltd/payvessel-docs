**Endpoint, parameters, response, and code samples** for retrieving the current balance of an external dedicated wallet.

## Full API reference (Swagger)

Request/response schemas and try-it-out are in the Payvessel PMS Swagger under **External Dedicated Wallet**:

**[External Dedicated Wallet — Swagger](https://api.payvessel.com/pms/api/docs/swagger/#/External%20Dedicated%20Wallet)**

Locate the **balance** (or equivalent) operation for the exact path, method (typically `GET`), and response body.

## Base URL and headers

| Environment | Base URL |
|-------------|----------|
| **Production** | `https://api.payvessel.com` |
| **Sandbox** | `https://sandbox.payvessel.com` |

| Header | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `api-key` | Yes | Your Payvessel public API key |
| `api-secret` | Yes | `Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY` |

## Example (generic)

After you have the path from Swagger (e.g. `GET /pms/api/.../wallet/{id}/balance`):

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.payvessel.com/pms/api/.../wallet/WALLET_ID/balance" \
  -H "api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "api-secret: Bearer YOUR_SECRET"
```

Replace the path and `WALLET_ID` with the values from the Swagger definition. Response shape (e.g. `balance`, `currency`) is documented there.

For the **conceptual guide**, see [Wallet Balance (guide)](/wallets/wallet-balance).
