# Supported Webhook Events

Payvessel emits structured events to help you react to changes across payments, transfers, wallets, and identity workflows. Subscribe to the events you need in the Dashboard and build handlers that map directly to the `event` field in the webhook payload.

<Tip>
Always verify the signature and implement idempotency before acting on an event. See [Verifying Webhooks](/api-reference/webhook/verifying-webhooks) for implementation guidance.

## Event Handling Checklist

- Log the `event`, `transaction.reference`, and timestamp for auditing.
- Queue long-running operations to avoid response timeouts.
- Provide manual replay tooling so operations teams can reprocess specific events.
- Monitor for event bursts—throttle downstream systems as needed.
