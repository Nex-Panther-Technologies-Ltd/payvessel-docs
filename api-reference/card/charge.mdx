<!--
  Card Payment — Charge: Submit encrypted card data to initiate a charge.
  Full flow and production-ready code: see Card Payment Overview (/api-reference/card/overview).
  Backend only; requires api-key + api-secret. Never send secret from frontend.
-->

Initiate a card payment by sending encrypted card data (encrypted with the [public key](/api-reference/card/public-key)). Use from your **backend** only. If the issuer requires 3DS/OTP/PIN, follow up with the validate endpoints and then [confirm status](/api-reference/card/confirm-status).
