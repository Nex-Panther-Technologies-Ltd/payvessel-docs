## Core API Workflows

### Accept a Payment

Here's your guide to using the Payvessel API to accept a single payment.

**Before you begin:** All Payvessel API requests must be authenticated with your secret API keys.

**Next Step:** `POST api.payvessel.com/transaction/initialize`

```bash
# cURL Example
curl https://api.payvessel.com/transaction/initialize \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": "500000", "email": "customer@email.com"}' \
  -X POST
```

### Initiate a Transfer

Here's how quickly you can send money programmatically with Payvessel.

**Before you begin:** All Payvessel API requests must be authenticated with your secret API keys.

**Next Step:** `POST api.payvessel.com/transfer/recipient`

```bash
# cURL Example
curl https://api.payvessel.com/transfer/recipient \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "nuban", "name": "John Doe", "account_number": "0001234567", "bank_code": "058"}' \
  -X POST
```
