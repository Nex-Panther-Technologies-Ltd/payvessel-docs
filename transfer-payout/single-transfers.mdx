# Single Transfers

**Send money to a single bank account or mobile money wallet** with a simple API call. Single transfers are ideal for instant refunds, user withdrawals, and on-demand payouts.

## How it Works

1.  **Select or Create a Recipient:** Ensure the recipient is registered with a `recipient_code`. See [Create Recipient](/api-reference/transfers/create-recipient).
2.  **Ensure Sufficient Balance:** Transfers are debited from your managed wallet balance immediately.
3.  **Trigger the Transfer:** Call the [Initiate Transfer](/api-reference/transfers/initiate-transfer) endpoint.
4.  **Confirm Delivery:** Monitor the status via webhooks (`transfer.success` or `transfer.failed`).

## Key Considerations

### Idempotency
Always send an `Idempotency-Key` header. This ensures that if your network fails and you retry the request, Payvessel will not process the same transfer twice.

### Transfer Statuses
- **pending:** The transfer is being processed by the banking network.
- **success:** The recipient's bank has acknowledged receipt of funds.
- **failed:** The transfer could not be completed (e.g., invalid account).
- **reversed:** Funds were sent but subsequently returned by the receiving bank.

## Sample Integration Flow

```javascript
// 1. Register the recipient
const recipient = await payvessel.transfer.recipient.create({ ... });

// 2. Send the money
const transfer = await payvessel.transfer.initiate({
  amount: "500000", // ₦5,000.00
  recipient: recipient.data.recipient_code,
  reason: "Account Withdrawal",
  reference: "ORDER_REF_9988",
});
```
