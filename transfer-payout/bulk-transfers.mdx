# Bulk Transfers

**Process multiple transfers in a single request** to save time and reduce integration complexity. Bulk transfers are perfect for payroll, multi-vendor settlements, and promotional disbursements.

## Ways to Process Bulk Transfers

### 1. Programmatic API (Bulk Transfer)
Use our API to send an array of transfer instructions. This is the preferred method for automated systems.

-   **Workflow:** Prepare a list of recipients and amounts, then send them in one `POST` request.
-   **Reference:** See [Bulk Transfer](/api-reference/transfers/bulk-transfer) API reference.

### 2. Dashboard Bulk Upload
If you prefer a no-code solution, you can upload a CSV file directly in the Payvessel Dashboard.

-   **Workflow:** Download the template, fill in the details, and upload.
-   **Format:** Standard CSV with headers: `account_number`, `bank_code`, `amount`, `reference`.

## Best Practices

-   **Batch Limits:** We recommend batches of 50-100 transfers per request for optimal processing speed.
-   **Validation:** Verify all recipients before adding them to a bulk batch to minimize failures.
-   **Reporting:** Use the [List Transfers](/api-reference/transfers/list-transfers) endpoint to reconcile your bulk batches later.
