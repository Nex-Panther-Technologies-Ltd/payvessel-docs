# Transfer to External Wallet

**Send money to external bank accounts or wallets** securely using Payvessel's Transfer APIs. This guide covers the end-to-end flow for moving funds from your managed wallet to a recipient.

## Integration Flow

To complete a transfer successfully, you must follow these three steps:

### 1. Create a Recipient
Before you can send money, you must register the recipient's details (bank account or mobile money wallet) and verify them. Payvessel automatically validates the account details during this step.

- **Action:** Call the [Create Recipient](/api-reference/transfers/create-recipient) endpoint.
- **Result:** You will receive a `recipient_code` (e.g., `RCP_xyz789...`).

### 2. Initiate the Transfer
Once you have a recipient code, you can trigger the fund movement.

- **Action:** Call the [Initiate Transfer](/api-reference/transfers/initiate-transfer) endpoint using the `recipient_code`.
- **Idempotency:** We highly recommend using an `Idempotency-Key` header to prevent duplicate transfers in case of network retries.

### 3. Track Status
Transfers can be instant or take some time depending on the channel.

- **Webhook (Recommended):** Configure a [Webhook](/api-reference/webhook/overview) to receive real-time updates when the status changes to `success`, `failed`, or `reversed`.
- **Polling:** Alternatively, you can use the [Verify Transfer](/api-reference/transfers/verify-transfer) endpoint to check the status manually.

## Best Practices

- **Verify Balance:** Check your managed wallet balance before initiating transfers to avoid `insufficient_balance` errors.
- **Handle OTP:** Some high-value transfers may require an OTP for security. Be prepared to handle the `otp` status response.
- **Detailed Narrations:** Use clear narrations (e.g., "Invoice #1234") to help your customers reconcile their bank statements.
